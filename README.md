# Coffee-Quality-Analysis
Project Overview  
This project explores coffee quality data using Power BI, analyzing sensory attributes, processing methods, and defect trends. It provides actionable insights for coffee producers, traders, and consumers to improve coffee quality.  

Objectives  
Analyze the relationship between sensory attributes and overall coffee quality.  
Assess the impact of processing methods and origin regions on quality.  
Identify trends in defect severity and their effects on coffee quality.  
Deliver insights to stakeholders in the coffee industry.    

Dataset Overview  
Source: Coffee Quality Institute (CQI)  
Scope: Sensory attributes, processing methods, origin regions, and defect occurrences.  
Purpose: Evaluate coffee quality through quantitative & qualitative measures.  

Key Variables  
Sensory Attributes: Aroma, flavor, acidity, body, aftertaste, balance, etc.  
Quality Metrics: Total Cup Points, Overall Score.  
Processing Methods: Washed, Natural, Honey, Semi-Washed, etc.  
Regional Data: Country or region of origin.  
Defect Measures: Category One & Category Two defects.  

Methodology  
Data Collection: Coffee Quality Institute dataset.  
Data Preprocessing:  
Replaced missing values.  
Standardized Bag Weight, Grading Date, Expiration Date.  
Converted non-English text to English.  
Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization using Power BI.  
Reporting & Insights Generation.  

Tools Used  
Power BI – Data preprocessing, visualization & reporting.  
Excel – Data Source. 

Insights & Findings  
Top sensory attributes influencing coffee quality: Sweetness, Uniformity, Clean Cup.  
Best processing methods: Double Anaerobic Washed, Honey Mossto, Semi-Washed.  
Top coffee-producing region: Ethiopia (highest average cup points).  
Defects Analysis:  
28 instances of Category One defects.  
466 instances of Category Two defects.  
Washed/Wet processed beans have more defects.  
Peak defect periods: November, April, and March.  
2021/2022 and 2022/2023 harvest years show the most defects.  

Actionable Recommendations  
Improve sensory attributes during cupping evaluations.  
Educate farmers on processing techniques for better quality coffee.  
Implement strategies to reduce defects for higher market value.
